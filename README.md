- [stylor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylor) - A module that creates virtual stylesheets for component-scoped styles.
- [pubber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pubber) - A tiny pubsub library for communication between components

## State Management
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org) - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org) - MobX is a battle tested library that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming.
- [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) - GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/reference/) - Apollo provides a universal GraphQL API on top of your existing services, so you can build new application features fast without waiting on backend changes.
- [State Machine](https://github.com/davestewart/javascript-state-machine) - State Machine is a library for managing a finite set of states, and moving between them via actions and transitions.

## Third Party Frameworks
- [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io) - Material Design Lite  includes new versions of common user interface controls such as buttons, check boxes, and text fields, adapted to follow Google's Material Design concepts.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) - Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the world's most popular front-end component library.

## Client Side Routing

Composi does not have its own router. That is beyond the scope of the aim of the project.
However, we do have a separate router that we like to use with Composi called [composi-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/composi-router). Example of usage: [Tour of Heroes](https://github.com/composor/tour-of-heroes)

You could also use any of the following popular client side routing libraries:

- [Universal Router](https://www.kriasoft.com/universal-router/)
- [Page](http://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/)
- [Routie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/routie-2)
- [Routy](https://github.com/KanoComputing/routy.js)
- [Webix-routie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webix-routie)
- [Roadtrip](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/roadtrip)
- [Jsrouter](https://github.com/jdlehman/jsrouter)
